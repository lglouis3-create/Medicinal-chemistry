/* Service worker for a course drill. build.py fills in SITE and writes the
   result to the repository root, beside index.html.

   What it is for: the drill keeps working with no connection (on a plane, in a
   basement lecture hall), and a flaky connection never leaves a student staring
   at a blank screen.

   What it must never do: hold a student on an outdated copy of the bank. A
   corrected answer key has to reach them on their next load. So the page is
   fetched network-first: when the network answers in time, the student gets the
   current page and the saved copy is refreshed from it. The saved copy is used
   only when the network is down or slower than NET_TIMEOUT, and if the network
   copy then turns out to be newer, the page is told so it can offer a reload.

   lglouis3-create.github.io serves every course's drill, and Cache Storage is
   shared across the whole origin. Every cache this worker creates is named
   PREFIX + 'v' + a number, PREFIX coming from the course's `ns`, and cleanup
   only ever deletes caches named exactly that way, so another course's offline
   copy is never touched, including one whose `ns` starts with this one's.

   A course that had its own worker before it moved onto the core names that
   worker's cache prefix in course.js `oldCachePrefix`; caches whose names start
   with it are deleted too. build.py refuses a prefix that would match this
   course's own caches.

   Generalized from Medicinal-chemistry's sw.js (ed38dbd). */
